# A little guide for me in how to use the markdown... "language"?

## Headers

How to use headers? Easy, before the text of your header, you only need to add a "**#**" before the text. If you want an h1 you only need to add one "**#**" but if you want an h2 you add two. Three for an h3 and so on. You don´t need a closing **#**, you can just add the simbol before your text and that's it.

## Emphasis

Italic and bold text, and that's it we don´t have more as far as i know. How can i use any of this? You can use "*" or "_". Suuuper easy. If you want the text to be italic you need to put the text between the symbols to use *italics* like this `*italics*` or `_italics_`.if you want it **bold** its almost the same but you need to doble the symbols like this `**bold**` or `__bold__` and you can combine them like this `_italics letters and also some **bold** ones_`.
